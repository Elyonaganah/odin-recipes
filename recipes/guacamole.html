    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Prepare the avocados
        <ul>
            Cut the avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pits.
            Scoop the avocado flesh into a mixing bowl using a spoon.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 2: Mash the avocados
        <ul>
            Use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocado until desired consistency is reached. Some prefer it chunky, while others like it smoother.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 3: Add lime juice
        <ul>
            Squeeze fresh lime juice over the mashed avocados. Start with one lime and adjust to taste.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 4: Mix in diced tomatoes
        <ul>
            Add the diced tomatoes to the mashed avocado. You can use Roma tomatoes or any other variety you prefer.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 5: Add finely chopped red onion
        <ul>
            Mix in the finely chopped red onion for a sharp flavor and crunchy texture.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 6: Stir in minced garlic
        <ul>
            Add the minced garlic to the mixture for a hint of pungent flavor. Adjust the amount to taste.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 7: Season with salt, pepper, and ground cumin
        <ul>
            Sprinkle salt, pepper, and ground cumin over the mixture. Start with a pinch of each and adjust according to taste preferences.
        </ul>
        <li>Step 8: Mix well
        <ul>
            Gently mix all the ingredients together until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, especially if you prefer a chunkier guacamole.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 9: Taste and adjust seasoning
        <ul>
            Taste the guacamole and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more lime juice, salt, pepper, or any other ingredient to balance the flavors.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 10: Serve and enjoy
        <ul>
           Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl and garnish with additional chopped cilantro or a slice of lime if desired. Serve immediately with tortilla chips or as a topping for tacos, nachos, or any of your favorite dishes.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 11: Optional - Chill
        <ul>
            
                If you prefer your guacamole chilled, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together even more.
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
