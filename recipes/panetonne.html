    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Activate the yeast:
        <ul>
            Dissolve the yeast in warm milk with a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
        </ul>
         </li>
        <li>Step 2: Prepare the dough:
        <ul>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the activated yeast mixture with flour, sugar, softened butter, eggs, vanilla extract, lemon zest, orange zest, and a pinch of salt. Mix until a sticky dough forms.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 3: Knead the dough:
        
        <ul>
            Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic. Incorporate candied fruits and raisins into the dough during the last few minutes of kneading.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 4: First rise:
        <ul>
            Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.           
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 5: Shape the dough:
        <ul>
            Punch down the risen dough and shape it into a ball. Place it in a panettone mold or a tall, cylindrical pan lined with parchment paper. Make a small cross-shaped incision on top of the dough.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 6: Second rise:
        <ul>
            Cover the shaped dough and let it rise again for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size and reaches the top of the panettone mold.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 7: Preheat the oven:
        <ul>
            Preheat the oven to the specified temperature (usually around 350°F or 180°C).
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 8: Bake:
        <ul>
            Bake the panettone in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes or until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Step 9: Cool:
        <ul>
            Remove the panettone from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
