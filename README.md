# odin-recipes

The current project involves building a simple recipe website as part of the Foundations course in The Odin Project. This project serves as an introduction to web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript. By completing this project, I will demonstrate several key skills:

1. **HTML Markup**: I learnt how to structure web pages using HTML, including creating headers, paragraphs, lists, and links to organize content effectively.

2. **CSS Styling**: I gained proficiency in styling my web pages using CSS, including defining layout, fonts, colors, and spacing to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.

3. **Responsive Design**: I understand how to make my website responsive, ensuring it looks and functions well across various devices and screen sizes, by employing techniques such as media queries and flexible layouts.

4. **Version Control with Git**: Throughout the project, I'll utilize Git for version control, enabling I to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage my project effectively.

5. **Problem-Solving Skills**: As I encounter challenges and bugs during the development process, I'll develop problem-solving skills by troubleshooting issues and finding solutions through research and experimentation.

Overall, this project provides me a hands-on opportunity to apply fundamental web development skills, laying a strong foundation for my journey as a web developer.
