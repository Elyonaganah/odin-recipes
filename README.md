# odin-recipes

The current project involves building a simple recipe website as part of the Foundations course in The Odin Project. This project serves as an introduction to web development, focusing on HTML. By completing this project, I will demonstrate several key skills:

1. **HTML Markup**: I learnt how to structure web pages using HTML, including creating headers, paragraphs, lists, and links to organize content effectively.

2. **Version Control with Git**: Throughout the project, I'll utilize Git for version control, enabling I to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage my project effectively.

3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: As I encounter challenges and bugs during the development process, I'll develop problem-solving skills by troubleshooting issues and finding solutions through research and experimentation.

Overall, this project provides me a hands-on opportunity to apply fundamental web development skills, laying a strong foundation for my journey as a web developer.
